Barring something unforeseen, there will be a review period for the final exam this Thursday from 3 to 4 p.m. in 2a213 for BOTH sections 
(it might be a bit crowded).  This is outside of normal class time because I don't want you to lose any work period time. 
Please e-mail me before 10 a.m. on Thursday with review requests.
