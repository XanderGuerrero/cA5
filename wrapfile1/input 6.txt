I've created a discussion forum for Exam Review questions.  
The intent for this is that everyone should post exam review questions (for the midterm exam, at this point) so that you can practice.  
I'll post some over the days until the exam but you definitely should post some as well.  Please post one question per posting.

Besides the obvious benefit of having question to help review for the exam, there will be marks associated with this as well.
